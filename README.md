# NM-project2.Tittle:Building a Speech-to-Text System with Integrated Language Modeling for Improved Accuracy in Transcription Services

Project Summary: ASR Pipeline with Language and Acoustic Model Integration

Data Collection & Cleaning Collect a large text corpus (e.g., Wikipedia, books) for language modeling. Use audio datasets like LibriSpeech or Common Voice for acoustic modeling. Clean data: normalize text, remove noise, and align audio with transcripts.

Data Analysis & EDA Perform tokenization and analyze common n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams). Extract audio features like MFCCs, pitch, and energy. Analyze word/sentence length distributions and audio durations/sampling rates. Evaluate VAD and noise reduction techniques.

Visualization Use Power BI to build dashboards for: Transcription metrics (WER, accuracy, precision) N-gram frequency (bar charts, word clouds) Audio features (MFCCs, spectrograms) Model performance comparisons (e.g., HMM vs. deep learning) Confusion matrices for error analysis

Advanced Analytics Train an n-gram language model using the text corpus. Develop an acoustic model using HMM or deep learning. Integrate the language and acoustic models to enhance transcription accuracy.

Results & Evaluation Integrated model should outperform standalone acoustic models. Language model reduces context-related transcription errors. Dashboards and visualizations demonstrate improved performance clearly.

3.TIttle:Building an End-to-End Speech Recognition Pipeline: Signal Processing, Acoustic Modeling, and Performance Evaluation

Project Summary: Noise-Robust Speech Recognition Pipeline

Data Collection & Cleaning Gather a speech corpus with both clean and noisy audio samples. Preprocess by normalizing volume, removing silence, and segmenting into frames. Apply noise reduction (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering).

Feature Extraction & Analysis Extract audio features: MFCCs, pitch, energy. Use Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to isolate speech segments. Analyze feature distributions and audio properties like duration and sampling rate.

Visualization Plot waveforms (raw vs. noise-reduced), spectrograms, and feature distributions. Use Power BI dashboards to visualize: Accuracy of different models (HMM vs. deep learning) Effects of various noise reduction methods Feature correlations and distributions

Advanced Modeling Train an HMM-based acoustic model. Build a simple deep learning model (e.g., CNN or RNN) for comparison. Evaluate models using Word Error Rate (WER) and accuracy.

Results & Evaluation Deliver a noise-robust ASR pipeline with meaningful feature extraction. Demonstrate improved accuracy over baseline models. Highlight comparative insights between traditional (HMM) and deep learning approaches.Real-Time Speech-to-Text System for Customer Support Automation

Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time speech-to-text system using synthetic customer support queries. It utilizes Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to generate audio samples, pydub to convert formats, and SpeechRecognition to transcribe the audio into text. The system is ideal for prototyping customer support automation solutions and is fully compatible with Google Colab.

Features

Converts predefined customer queries into audio files.

Uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to simulate voice input.

Transcribes WAV audio files using Google Web Speech API.

Displays both audio playback and transcription within a Colab environment.
